 # Queuing System
 
This project simulates a queuing system, analyzing customer arrival and service times to determine queue lengths, waiting times, and other key metrics. 
It also provides insights into whether an additional server is needed based on the calculated statistics.

# Features

Simulation of Customer Arrivals and Service Times: Generates random inter-arrival and service times for customers.
Queue Statistics Calculation: Computes important metrics such as waiting time, queue length, and server utilization.
Manager Recommendations: Provides recommendations on whether additional servers are needed based on thresholds.

# How It Works

1-Generate Queuing Table: The script generates a table with arrival times, service start and end times,
waiting times, and queue lengths for each customer.
2-Analyze Statistics: It calculates average waiting time, average queue length, and server utilization.
3-Manager Decision: Based on the calculated metrics, it suggests whether adding another server is necessary.
